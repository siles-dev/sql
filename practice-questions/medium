Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.

    SELECT DISTINCT(SUBSTRING(birth_date, 1, 4))
    FROM patients
    ORDER BY birth_date ASC;

    or

    SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(birth_date) AS birth_year
    FROM patients
    ORDER BY birth_year;

Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list.
Ex: If two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list.
If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output.

    SELECT first_name
    FROM patients
    GROUP BY first_name
    HAVING COUNT(first_name) = 1;
